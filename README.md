Just a quick thank you to GitHub user **thammin**, for creating a package template that follows the guidelines laid out in Unity's official documentation. It helped get this project off the ground more quickly, and it might help you with your own packages. Check it out: [https://github.com/thammin/unity-custom-package-template]
